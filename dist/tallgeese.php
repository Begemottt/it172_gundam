                <p>The Tallgeese was designed in After Colony 170 by the five scientists and served as the prototype for all subsequent mobile suits. It was extremely powerful, but expensive to mass-produce and rough on its pilots, so its design was later simplified, resulting in the Leo. In After Colony 195, it was restored and test piloted by an OZ soldier named Otto. It was then used by its prominent pilot, Zechs Merquise, to combat the Gundams. Between episodes 18 and 22, the Tallgeese was modified for space travel, allowing Zechs (as Milliardo Peacecraft) to visit the colonies. In episode 34, the Tallgeese was destroyed via self destruction, allowing Zechs to claim the Wing Zero. The remaining spare parts of Zech's Tallgeese were later assembled into a Tallgeese for Treize Khushrenada, and designated the Tallgeese II.</p>
                <p>Another Tallgeese, nicknamed 'Shilong', was developed by Master O of the Long Clan (of which Chang Wufei was a member) and was destroyed while defending the Long Clan's colony in After Colony 194. It appeared in the Episode Zero and Glory of Losers manga, and lacked a mask over its camera, making it more visually similar to a Leo.[2]</p>
