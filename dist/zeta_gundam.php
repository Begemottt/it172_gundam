                <p>Early in the Gryps Conflict, Kamille, having just stolen the Gundam Mk-II, had ideas for upgrading his unit which took inspiration from the RMS-099 Rick Dias, and would present his design to Astonaige Medoz. This eventually led to his design ideas being incorporated into the Zeta Gundam.</p>
                <p>Replacing the Gundam Mk-II as his personal Mobile Suit, Kamille obtained the Zeta Gundam after returning to space from the Hong Kong incident involving Four Murasame. Screaming into battle, this sleek convertible Mobile Suit took all of the Titans' forces by surprise with its incredible performance and attack potential. Kamille led many successful missions against the Titans and the A.E.U.G. turned the tide of the war. The Zeta was responsible for battling and ultimately killing Titans leader Paptimus Scirocco, besting his powerful mobile suit, the PMX-003 The O.</p>
                <p>A.E.U.G. pilot Fa Yuiry later recovered the Zeta Gundam along with Kamille, who was rendered in a vegetative state after a final psychic attack by Scirocco. After undergoing repairs, the Newtype Judau Ashta became its principal pilot while the newer MSZ-010 ΖΖ Gundam was under construction by Anaheim Electronics. During a battle with Mashymre Cello's AMX-103 Hamma Hamma and Chara Soon's AMX-104 R-Jarja, the Zeta Gundam's head was destroyed by the Hamma Hamma's shield beam gun. Due to a shortage of spare parts aboard the Argama, the Zeta Gundam was temporarily fitted with a salvaged MS-06F Zaku II's head, thus earning the nickname "Zeta Zaku". The temporary fix by Iino Abbav worked, however the cockpit screen reverted to an old-fashioned display, as the Zaku II head was not built for the 360-degree panoramic cockpit.</p>
                <p>When Judau received the ZZ Gundam, Roux Louka became the Zeta Gundam's designated pilot, using it to great success during the war against Neo Zeon. Judau would occasionally trade mobile suits with Roux, as the Zeta Gundam was better suited for speed and mobility. The Zeta Gundam operated until its destruction at the end of the First Neo Zeon War, crippled by Ple Two's monstrous NZ-000 Queen Mansa, although the Zeta got in one final crippling shot before being abandoned.</p>
